# Description
This repository consists of implementation of different kinds of deep learning models along with different training and testing methodologies using python3 and numpy.
The repository is divided into the following directories:
1. [linearRegressionWithSGD]{/linearRegressionWithSGD}: This directory consists of implementation of linear regression with stochastic gradient descent for age predection problem, and double cross entropy for selecting the best hyperparameters.
2. ClassificationCrossEntropy: This directory consists of implementation of multi class classification neural network with cross entropy loss on Fashion MNist Dataset.
