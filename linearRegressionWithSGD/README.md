# Description
This is the implementation of K fold cross validatio, Double cross validation and stochastic gradient descent which is a foundational training method for all shallow and deep neural networks.

## Running the code
1. Dataset is provided in this repository.
2. To run, install Python 3.5+, an numpy.
3. Run the command python3 runner.py to run Double cross validation, and stochastic gradient descent

## Result:
The code yields an accuracy of and MSE loss of 110 over the whole testing data.
